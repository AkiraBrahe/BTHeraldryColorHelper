# BT Heraldry Color Helper

This small BattleTech mod displays the ColorSwatch ID on the Heraldry screen in-game to help in creating new color schemes, which should be particularly useful since the colors appear to be randomly ordered on that screen.

For non-modders, all faction units in BattleTech use a HeraldryDef file to define their specific color scheme, and you need these color IDs to create or modify those files. You can look [here](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?l=german&id=2638707115) for a guide on how you can edit them.
