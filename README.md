# BT Heraldry Color Helper

A small BattleTech mod that displays the ColorSwatch ID directly on the Heraldry screen in game.

## Info
I made this small mod to help in creating new color schemes, which should be particularly useful since the colors are randomly ordered on the Heraldry screen.

For non-modders, all faction units in BattleTech use a HeraldryDef file to define their specific color scheme, and you need these color IDs to create or modify those files. You can look [here](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?l=german&id=2638707115) for a guide on how you can edit them.
